/**
 * Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values.
 *
 * Any null field is ignored (left unchanged).
 *
 * If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is
 * needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself.
 *
 * But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey.
 *
 * The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will
 * be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications
 * to the state of the instance.
 *
 * If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be
 * changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added.
 * So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable.
 * But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the
 * admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to
 * agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the management
 * of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created
 * without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable.
